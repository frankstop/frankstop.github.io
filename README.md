# Frank Valdez

A multi-page experimental portfolio built from custom browser graphics, shared Jekyll components, and independently deployed GitHub projects.

## Interactive Experiences

| Page | Experience | How it works |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Home** | Particle vortex | An HTML canvas renders 12,000 particles moving through four mathematical vortex fields in a continuous animation loop. |
| **Skills** | Fireworks display | A full-window canvas creates launches, trails, explosions, and a generated star field. It scales for high-density displays and adapts when reduced motion is preferred. |
| **Projects** | Live Matrix Rain background | The independently deployed [MatrixRain](https://github.com/frankstop/MatrixRain) project is embedded as the page's animated hero background. |
| **Projects** | In-page project previews | A reusable modal loads deployed applications on demand, allowing visitors to explore them without leaving the portfolio. |
| **About** | Live resume viewer | The separately deployed [Resume](https://github.com/frankstop/Resume) site is embedded directly into an accessible modal. |
| **Games** | Browser game catalog | A responsive catalog presents six independently deployed games at first-party routes on frankiejvaldez.com. |

## Cross-Repository Composition

The portfolio can use independently maintained GitHub Pages sites as components:

- **MatrixRain** provides the animated environment behind the Projects heading.
- **Resume** supplies the live document shown in the About page's resume viewer.
- **Project previews** load deployed applications inside a shared iframe-based modal.

Each project remains independently deployable while the portfolio brings them together into one experience.

```

GitHub Actions builds the site with Jekyll and deploys it to GitHub Pages.
Jekyll processes the shared header and footer includes while individual pages
remain free to define their own visual systems and interactive behavior.

Games keep their own repositories and deployments. The portfolio exposes them
at lowercase canonical URLs such as
`https://frankiejvaldez.com/games/metrodash/`; title-case and mixed-case links
normalize to the same route. See [`docs/GAMES.md`](docs/GAMES.md) for the
small add-a-game checklist.

## Technology

- HTML5 and CSS3
- Vanilla JavaScript
- Canvas 2D API
- Tailwind CSS
- Jekyll and Liquid includes
- Responsive iframe integrations
- GitHub Pages
- Google Fonts

## Interaction and Accessibility

- Escape-key dismissal for responsive navigation and modal dialogs
- Focus placement for opened dialogs and focus return in the resume viewer
- Responsive navigation shared across the site
- Reduced-motion adaptation for the fireworks effect
- High-density display scaling for canvas graphics
- Lazy-loaded external experiences
- Descriptive iframe titles and decorative-background isolation

## Analytics

Every public page uses the shared `_includes/analytics.html` include with the
GA4 measurement ID `G-RSVR6Y389R`. Page views identify the rendered page with
its title, pathname, and query-free first-party location.

High-value interactions are recorded through `assets/js/analytics.js`:

| Event | Purpose | Parameters |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `resume_view` | Resume modal opened | `placement` |
| `contact_click` | Email, GitHub, or LinkedIn selected | `method`, `placement` |
| `project_preview_open` | In-page project preview opened | `project_name` |
| `project_link_click` | Live site, repository, or preview CTA selected | `project_name`, `link_type` |
| `game_open` | Featured or catalog game selected | `game_name`, `placement` |
| `certificate_click` | Credential link selected | `certificate_name` |
| `page_not_found` | The 404 page rendered | `page_path` |

The helper accepts only the parameters above. It does not send email
addresses, destination URLs, query strings, or visitor-entered content, and it
fails safely when Google Analytics is unavailable.

To verify a deployment in Google Analytics:

1. Open **Reports → Realtime** and use **Page title and screen name** to confirm
   the page being tested.
2. Open the resume, a project preview, a game, or a contact link.
3. Confirm the matching event appears in **Event count by Event name**.
4. Use **Admin → DebugView** with Google Tag Assistant when inspecting event
   parameters during development.

## Local Development

The pages use Jekyll includes, so preview the site through Jekyll rather than opening the HTML files directly:

```bash
jekyll serve
```

Then visit `http://localhost:4000`.

Run the analytics checks with:

```bash
node --test _tests/*.test.mjs
```

Changes pushed to `main` are built by the Pages workflow and published at
[frankiejvaldez.com](https://frankiejvaldez.com/).
